A theme from [Susan C Pinsky's "organizational systems"](https://www.organizationallyours.com/books/organizing-solutions-for-people-with-adhd/) book:

- make it easier to put things away, than to get new things or to take things out


## Reusable things: clothes, pots, pans, flatware, tools
For things you periodically reuse, make it easy to put things into storage. 

Adam Savage's principle for storage systems of "first order of retrieval" is, by the same token, a "first order of putting-away." Storage should have open access (front or top) or at most 1 step (open a door/lid/drawer) to access the storage.

## Consumable supplies: ingredients for cooking, toothpaste, shampoo

For things you consume and need to replace, make it easy to fetch the replacements! Pinsky advises "only keep enough supplies on hand to make it to your next shopping run (and if you run out between shopping runs, you're clever and make do with something else).
