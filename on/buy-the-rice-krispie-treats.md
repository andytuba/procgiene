## Let's make some Rice Krispie Treats

Tools: 

* Pot (stovetop) or mixing bowl (microwave)
* Wooden spoon
* Baking pan

Supplies:
* Plastic wrap

Ingredients:

* Rice Krispies cereal (12oz): $5
* Mini marshmallows (10oz): $2
* Butter (4 tbsp): $0.65
* Vanilla extract (1/2 tsp): $0.15

Time:

* 20min to "bake"
* Wait, make that 30min while I got distracted on twitter and the goop congealed in the bowl and I had to microwave it again so I could transfer them to the pan
* 1 hour wait while treats cool in the fridge
* 20 min to wash the dish
* Wait, make 30 minutes because "let it soak .. wait, that's not how marshmallows work"
* 20 minute to cut up treats and plastic-wrap them individually

Waste:

* wash water
* plastic wrap

Yield: 24 treats (I guess? I ate two rows already)

Shelf life:
* who knows
* they never last more than a week or two
