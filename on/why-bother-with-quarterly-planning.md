tldr: Quarterly project planning may seem a fool's errand, but in a big organization it can be less foolish than no planning.

Here's the problems:

* It's hard to estimate how long a project will take, especially projects that require research or investigation.
* A lot of specialists depend on each other to complete projects.
* Some projects depend on other projects.
* The longer a project drags on, the harder it gets to finish.

So we try to break down projects into small chunks, then schedule out project chunks so the projects get done and nbody is overworked or waiting idly.
