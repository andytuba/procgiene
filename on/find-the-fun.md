Sometimes I didn't want to do some project for school. But mom said "you gotta do it, you're accountable to your teacher for getting it done, that's part of your grade. If you're not interested in doing the project because it doesn't look fun, maybe you should look a little deeper to find some fun in it."

I'm not sure when she started advocating for "find the fun"; this wisdom might be passed down from her parents. But when I was looking at [the FlyLady website](./flylady), I noticed the shop's tagline: "Make it fun, it will get done!"

Find your spoonful of sugar, to make your medicine go down!
