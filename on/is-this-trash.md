Hint: you probably don't need it.

My mom started following the [FlyLady](./flylady) tip of triaging stuff to purge:

- will I use this in the next 1-3 months? (Have I used it in the previous 3 months?)
- if I won't use it within 3 months, can I easily replace it when I need it? or can I convert/replace it to something that's easier to store?
- if I will use it within 12-36 months but this thing is expensive to replace, where can I afford to store it?
