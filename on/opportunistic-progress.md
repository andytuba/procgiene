Today's task: break down the cardboard that's piling up by the front door for recycling.

I got started... but then I got distracted because I was thirsty.

My waterbottle is empty. Let's take it to the kitchen sink.

While the waterbottle is filling up,* I'll clean the kitchen a little.

I see the kitchen trash is full. Let's take that out to the garage.

Turns out I left some cardboard boxes in the garage. I'll bring those inside to break down with the rest.

And ... we're back at the stack of cardboard boxes. The task may be a little taller than when I started, but I still took care of a bunch of small rocks!

\* Kinda wanna buy an internet-of-trash kitchen faucet that I can yell at to "okay gluggle, fill my waterbottle."
