If the trash bin is ready to be emptied, then it is time to empty the trash. We can't afford to pile up trash on top of the bin: that makes it even harder to take out any trash!

## If the trash is smelly, it's full: take it out

If there's something grody, grungy, smelly, and gross in the trash -- that bin is ready to go!

That smell (or spores or liquid or whatever) will leak outside the trash bin, especially when I open the lid. Then I'm scared to open the lid and let the grossness spread. Instead I should just move that trash out of the house and on its way to Recology.


## Eyes on the prize: get the trash out of the house

Our primary responsibility for trash day is "put the big bins out by the curb."

Put a recurring reminder to "put out big bins" on "trash days" -- but nothing else that day. Let's not block on doing the necessary thing (take out the big bins) with nice-to-have things (take out small bins too).

_After_ the big bins are put out, it's okay to keep up the inertia and follow up with small bins. But it's okay if we don't, because ...

## Don't wait for trash day

Time is meaningless and we'll forget when it's trash day. Take out the trash whenever. Take out the trash early and ofen.
