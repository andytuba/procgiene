If I want to quickly experiment with a bunch of options... I know: I'll use a computer! Computers are great at messing a lot of things up quickly.

I can use a computer to put together a bot that writes zines:


* on how to make a **zine** with **pen & paper**

* about designing a **bot** with **[Tracery](https://tracery.io)**

* that can compose many **variations** on how to design bots that write zines

* (so we can **talk** about it at **[Wavelength Conf](https://wavelengthconf)**)

... but what are all these things?
