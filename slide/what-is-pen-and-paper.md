A paper is a flat thing, usually made from wood pulp, that people write on, draw on, paint on, print on, fold up, tear up, cut up, tape together, and eventually put in the recycling/compost bins.

A pen is a long, straight thing that dispenses ink through the tip, that people use to write on paper. (or chew on. no judgement.)
