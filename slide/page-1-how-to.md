This is a how-to talk: *how to* build a Tracery bot *so that we can* make zines about Tracery bots.

(Did you attend the workshop on [making zines](https://wavelengthconf.com/make-your-zine/), and see the guide on [how-to zine](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEkasexP5c/BQy5HAYYuz1f5tbhByJh1Q/view)?  That's this session, layered on itself a few times.
