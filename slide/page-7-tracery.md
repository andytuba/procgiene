Time to convert the "final draft" text into a plain Tracery grammar.


```json
{  
    "origin": "#FrontCover# \n\n #Page1# \n\n #Page2# \n\n #Page3#",
    "FrontCover": "Cover page \n---\n\n How-to \"Generate a How-To Zine\" Zine \n\n A WavelengthConf Progzine",
    "Page1": "Page 1 \n---\n\n How-to \n\n write a bot \n that makes zines  \n\n  SO THAT YOU CAN \n\n make the best \n zine-ziner-zines",
    "Page2": "Page 2 \n---\n\n I have many ideas on \n how to craft a zine, \n\n but struggle with picking \n the best phrasing.",
    "Page3": "Page 3 \n---\n\n With a Tracery bot, \n I can generate \n many different phrasings \n and pick my favorites to draw!"
}
```

That's our Tracery version (above) of our plain text (below).
