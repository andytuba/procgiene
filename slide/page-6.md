When building Tracery bots, I prefer following a "molding and casting" process:

1. Write out a "final version" of my desired final product (more or less)
2. Make a mold derived from it: convert it into a Tracery grammar
3. Enhance the mold by adding placeholders/variations
4. Make "castings" from my mold by putting the grammar through a Tracery-powered generator
5. Pick my favorite castings and throw away the rest
