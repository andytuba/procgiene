My process for writing Tracery bots:

1. Hand-write a "final draft"
2. Convert it into a Tracery grammar
3. Identify "synonyms" and turn them into placeholders
4. Add more options for the placeholders
5. Generate a bunch of variations from the Tracery grammar
6. Pick out my favorite variations

I'll walk through this process, using the "How-To Zine Template" that Marlena shared during the WavelengthConf zine workshop.
